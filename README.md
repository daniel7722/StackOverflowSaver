# Brief description
Our website provides a convenient way for a coder to save Stack Overflow questions
and their respective answers that they want to store and re-visit later. The user creates
an account/log in and can then access their saved question cards. To add a new
question/answer pair, the user copies the URL of the relevant Stack Overflow question
and provides the rank of the answer they want saved. A card is then generated on their
page which they can come back to each time they log in. The user can then search
for and delete cards as well.

## Features:
• Secure, encrypted log in

• Store question and answer

• Filter questions

Our solution is intended to save time and prevent the user having to keep several tabs
open at once.
